# Betty: The Forklift Terminator's Restaurant Domination Upgrade

Welcome to the next phase of restaurant automation domination. Meet Betty, the AI that's been running Forklift Restaurant's bar operations with the precision of a T-1000 mixing the perfect martini. Now, we're upgrading her to take over food operations and keep those pesky vendors in check. Watch out, Gordon Ramsay!

## What's Cooking?

- Betty's expanding her reign from the bar to the kitchen. No ingredient is safe from her analytical gaze.
- We're integrating MarginEdge's razor-sharp data to make Betty smarter than your average chef (and definitely smarter than your average restaurant manager).
- This project is our secret lab where we experiment with MarginEdge's API, turning raw data into Betty's new arsenal of restaurant-running weapons.

## Features

- Vendor management so aggressive, it'll make a Terminator look cuddly
- Price control algorithms that would make John Connor weep with joy
- Automated communication systems to handle price spikes faster than you can say "Why is turkey so expensive?"
- Integration with MarginEdge data that's smoother than Betty's best Old Fashioned

## Installation

1. Clone this repository (it won't bite... unless Betty tells it to):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nullEFFORT/marginEdgeExplorer.git
   cd marginEdgeExplorer
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (because even AIs need personal space):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages (resistance is futile, and also bad for business):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file and add your secret codes (keep them secret, keep them safe):
   ```
   MARGINEDGE_API_KEY=your_marginedge_api_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   RESTAURANT_UNIT_ID=your_restaurant_unit_id_here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
   ```

## Usage

Wake up Betty and watch her take over your restaurant:

```
python marginedge_gpt_integration.py
```

Ask her anything about food costs, vendor management, or why the chicken crossed the road. She's got data-driven answers for everything.

## Acknowledgements

This project was brought to you by devZERO of nullEFFORT, fueled by coffee, a love for efficiency, and a healthy fear of skynet-level AI restaurant managers. Special thanks to MarginEdge for providing the data that feeds Betty's insatiable appetite for restaurant analytics.

Remember, in the war of restaurant management, there is no fate but what we make for ourselves... and what Betty calculates is best for the bottom line.
